Pakistan is an agricultural country where a large part of the population depends on farming.
However, many of our farmers lack proper agricultural training and are often unable to identify diseases in their crops.
As a result, they leave their crops untreated — leading to two major problems:
1️⃣ Crop damage or complete loss.
2️⃣ Reduced yield and lower productivity.

To address this critical issue, we proudly present 
 AgriSphere Bot 🌱

AgriSphere is an AI-powered intelligent agriculture assistant designed to help farmers detect crop issues early, understand diseases, and receive expert recommendations for treatment and care.

📸 Simply send a picture of your crop, and AgriSphere will analyze it to provide the disease name, helpful remedies, fertilizer suggestions, and care tips ( all in both Urdu and English.) 

✨ This is the initial release of AgriSphere  and we’re just getting started!
Many more brilliant features and powerful AI capabilities are on the way to make farming smarter, easier, and more productive for everyone. 🌾💡

The goal of AgriSphere is to empower every farmer to become the doctor of their own crops, ensuring healthier harvests and a stronger agricultural future for Pakistan
